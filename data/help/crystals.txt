## Crystals!
Everybody loves crystals!

Crystals add effects to badges.  Depending on the rarity, the changes can be subtle or dramatic.  Make your favorite badges even better with the power of crystals!

Follow these simple steps for a crystal enriched life:
1. When you earn a Pattern Buffer from leveling up or Tongo dividends, you can make a new, random crystal with `/crystal replicate`.
2. See your crystals (and how they look on your favorite badge) with `/crystals manifest`.
3. Then add them to a badge with `/crystals attach`.
4. Turn on the effect with `/crystals activate`.

Now itâ€™s time to show off your improved badge with `/badges spotlight` or `/profile set_badge`!
