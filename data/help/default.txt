*AGIMUS is a multipurpose Discord bot by the Friends of Desoto! AGIMUS does all sorts of things, including: XP/leveling, currency, trivia, poker, slots, AI chat, and more!*

**How does leveling/XP work?**

> You can earn XP by participating on the server in many ways: posting messages, adding reactions, interacting with the bot, and more!
> When you level up, you'll earn a random Star Trek-related badge! Check your badges by using the `/badges` command.
> Check your level, XP, number of badges and more by using the `/profile` command.

**What's the difference when I start a message with "computer:" and "agimus:"?**

> The "__computer:__" prefix will tell the bot to try to find factual information about whatever you posted. e.g.: "*computer: convert 24f to celsius*"
> The "__agimus:__" prefix will tell the bot to come up with something from its imagination -- using AI algorithms and various public data. e.g.: "*agimus: what is the meaning of life?*"

**The bot don't work!**

>  Please send a message in #ã€”ðŸ’¾ã€•megalomaniacal-computer-storage or ping <@572540272563716116> if you have any problems.
