*AGIMUS is a multipurpose Discord bot by the Friends of DeSoto! AGIMUS does all sorts of things, including: XP/leveling, currency, trivia, poker, slots, and more!*

**How does leveling/XP work?**

> You can earn XP by participating on the server in many ways: posting messages, adding reactions, interacting with the bot, and more!
>  
> When you level up, you'll earn a random Star Trek-related badge! Check your badges by using the `/badges showcase` command.
>  
> Check your level, XP, number of badges and more by using the `/profile display` command.
