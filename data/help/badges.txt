**EXAMPLE OF A TRADE**

1. Quark really wants the *"Volleyball Court"* Badge and is willing to trade his *"The Lucky Ferengi"* and *"Tongo Card (Sample)"* badges to get it. He sees that Weyoun has the *"Volleyball Court"* badge and decides to make an offer.

2. Quark uses `/trade start user:@Weyoun offer:"The Lucky Ferengi" request:"Volleyball Court"` to start a pending trade with Weyoun as the recipient.

3. Quark uses `/trade propose offer:"Tongo Card (Sample)"` to add his first badge to the pending trade.

7. Quark uses `/trade status` to verify everything looks good to go, and then presses the Send button. Weyoun gets a notification letting them know that Quark has made an offer and the channel is also alerted that the trade is underway!

8. Weyoun uses `/trade pending` to view Quark's offer and presses Accept (Weyoun also could have also pressed Decline if they did not wish to engage the trade).

9. Successful trade! A notification is sent to both Quark and the channel to let them know that the transfer was made successfully! Quark now owns the *"Volleyball Court"* badge and Weyoun owns both *"The Lucky Ferengi"* and *"Tongo Card (Sample)"* badges.

10. There is much rejoicing.
