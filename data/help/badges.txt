**EXAMPLE OF A TRADE**

1. Quark really wants the *"Volleyball Court"* Badge and is willing to trade his *"The Lucky Ferengi"* and *"Tongo Card (Sample)"* badges to get it. He sees that Weyoun has the *"Volleyball Court"* badge and decides to make an offer.

2. Quark uses `/trade initiate @Weyoun` to start a pending trade with Weyoun as the recipient.

3. Quark uses `/trade offer <add> "The Lucky Ferengi"` to add his first badge to the pending trade.

4. Quark uses `/trade offer <add> "Tongo Card (Sample)"` to add his second badge to the pending trade.

5. Quark uses `/trade request <add> "Volleyball Court"` to add Weyoun's badge to the pending trade.

6. Quark uses `/trade status` to verify everything looks good to go.

7. Quark uses `/trade activate` to send the request to Weyoun.  Weyoun gets a notification letting them know that Quark has made an offer and the channel is also alerted that the trade is underway!

9. Weyoun uses `/trade reply` to view Quark's offer and presses Accept (they could have also pressed Decline if they did not wish to engage the trade).

10. Successful trade! A notification is sent to both Quark and the channel to let them know that the transfer was made successfully! Quark now owns the *"Volleyball Court"* badge and Weyoun owns both *"The Lucky Ferengi"* and *"Tongo Card (Sample)"* badges.
