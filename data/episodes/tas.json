Neither Spock nor anyone else who were on the planet have a memory of the Andorian, while no one on the Enterprise remembers Spock! Computer records indicate Spock died as a youngster during a Vulcan ritual, and that they were scanning the Guardian when it was \"\"running\"\" that period of time. Since Spock didn't go through to save himself, he altered the timeline. The Guardian sends Spock through where he pretends to be a distant cousin. He meets Amanda and Sarek and an embittered young Spock. Young Spock eventually tries to undertake the desert ritual on his own and is almost killed. His pet sehlat saves him at the cost of its own life before Old Spock can show up. The timeline restored, everything is put back to normal.",

It replicates Kirk's shirts with \"\"Kirk is a Jerk\"\" on the back, manufacturers devices that leave a black eye ring on Spock, and shoot cream pies out of the food devices. Things take a turn for the worse when McCoy, Sulu, and Uhura are trapped in thea holodeck where they are beset by dangerous weather phenomena. They are rescued by Scotty when he bypasses the controls, but the Enterprise crew are further endangered when the Romulans attack and the ship's computer overrides manual controls. By feigning fear of the cloud, Kirk tricks the ship's computer into entering the cloud, which reverses the process. As they depart, they pick up transmissions from the pursuing Romulan ship that they are experiencing strange phenomena from their computer...",

They are attacked by a serpent-shaped energy field belonging to a feathered serpent who claims to be Kulkukan of Mayan-Aztec legend. It beams Kirk, McCoy, Scott, and Ensign Walking Bear aboard its ship to solve its puzzle before he will reveal himself. Aligning the mirrors in a strange city, they solve the puzzle and Kulkukan appears before them. It takes them to its \"\"zoo\"\" of violent creatures that now live in tranquility. Spock figures a way to break Kulkukan's force field and Kirk uses the diversion to free the animals. Kulkukan realizes that is not a god, but just a delusional old alien that once helped the younger races along. It leaves in sadness, leaving McCoy to remember the Shakespearean quote, \"\"How sharper than a serpent's tooth is an ungrateful child...\"\"",
