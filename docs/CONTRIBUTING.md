# Welcome to the AGIMUS Contribution Guide! âœ¨

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AGIMUS project for [The USS Hood](https://drunkshimoda.com), a Discord server for the "Friends of DeSoto" aka Fans of [The Greatest Trek](https://gagh.biz) family of podcasts!

AGIMUS is our Discord bot and handles a lot of functionality for the server such as automatically assigning roles when folks introduce themselves, granting XP for fun rewards, and then some strange wacky stuff like automatically changing the color of some lights in the project founder jp00p's room when new messages are received.

In this guide you'll get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, and submitting it for inclusion in the project!

### Wait, what the heck is a PR?

A "PR" means a **Pull Request** and is terminology used in programming and github specifically to indicate that you have changes that you'd like merged into the main code project.

Don't worry though, if you'd like to contribute documentation or general ideas you won't have to touch a single line of code!

## Getting Started

First thing's first, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the general project. Even if you won't be doing any coding yourself, a thorough read of the main [README](README.md) is recommended and contains some good overall information about what the bot can currently do.

If you have any questions or need some help, feel free to reach out on the Discord server in the [**"megalomaniacal-computer-storage"**](https://discord.com/channels/689512841887481875/994412232052052089) channel!

## Issues

Issues are what we use to track ideas, file bugs, or point out things that may need improvement in the project. You can find the [Issues tab](https://github.com/jp00p/AGIMUS/issues) at the top of the project's [Github page](https://github.com/jp00p/AGIMUS).

### Creating New Issues

If you have some ideas or notice a bug, feel free to submit an issue to track and it will be added to our list of items to tackle.

There are no hard rules on how to format your issue titles/descriptions but just try to be thorough and clear in what the desired resolution should be. [Markdown] is fully supported and you can add screenshots or images directly into the description field by either dragging them in or by pasting.

### Solving An Issue

You're welcome to scan through our existing issues to find one which may interest you. As a general rule, we don't assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to [open a PR] with a fix.

## Documentation

### Markdown

**Markdown** is a syntax for easily formatting text. Markdown files are designated with a `.md` suffix and when viewed on Github will automatically be rendered with the formatting applied. This document itself is written in Markdown and may provide a good example for how to format your own documentation.

Full details on the syntax can be found on the [markdownguide.org site|https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax].
