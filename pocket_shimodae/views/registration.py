        Supposedly it's a holodeck program that's intensely immersive, addicting, and nobody knows who wrote it. Everyone's been talking about it, or at least they were a few days ago, but now the ship seems oddly quiet.\n
        Having never been briefed on the dangers of alien games or even Ktarians, you naively decide to try it for yourself: you punch in your access codes, and step into the holodeck.\n
        The doors quickly close behind you, and a familiar voice crackles from the intercom:\n
        "WELCOME TO POCKET SHIMODAE, FOOLISH MORTAL!\n
        The doors are locked, and of course the safeties are off. You must play the game and prove your worth as a Poshimo Trainer before I will consider letting you escape."\n\n
